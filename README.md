# Newly Overhauled Course: HTML, CSS, JS:

## HTML (Start from the beginning):

1. Open an index file to mark up the html code for the start of the course.
2. Create a readme file to keep track of the progress while working.
3. Update all the information within the readme file. Make sure that all content will be saved and pushed to the remote.
4. Create a new file to hold the assets for the beginner_course project.
5. Create the css stylesheet and create the file to hold the js files. 
6. Begin the process all over from the very beginning- html tags and their uses.
7. Update the readme file and the html file- save and push all content to git.
8. Next step, creating lists within the html document- ordered and unordered or bullet lists
