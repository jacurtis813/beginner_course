    <p>Create a basic profile webpage to showcase the knowledge from memory and reaserch along the way.</p>

    <h2>What are some things you would like us to know about you?</h2>

    <p>My full name is clearly stated within the page- so we can bypass that main feature. I am a 28 year old full-time
        college student, an expectant father by Feb. 10th 2020, and I aspire to work remotely from home to keep my
        pregnant girlfriend and my baby girl safe.</p>

    <h2>WHat are some of your favorite things to do or enjoy?</h2>

    <p>My favorite color is green. I love wathcing sports- football, baseball, and hockey are my top three favorites. I
        truly enjoy learning about mark up, mark down, and coding languages. I enjoy reading and learning about history-
        through books, movies, or documentaries.</p>
